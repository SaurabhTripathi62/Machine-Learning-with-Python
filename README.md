All kind of codes and use of library 
Details are given in files

## I have worked on Supervised, Unsupervised,Semi-Supervised, Reinforcement learning.

Worked on:
#### Linear Regression, Clusters, Classification, Feature Reduction

### Basic Regressions Like:
#### 1.Linear Regression (When Numerical)
#### 2.Logistic Regression (Classification)(When Categorical target data)

### Cluster Analysis:
#### 1.K-mean (Similar values / centre point ) 
#### 2.Anomaly Detection (Finding outliner)

### Classification:
#### 1.K-NN (Folds)
#### 2.Decision Tree(Non continuous data)
#### 3.Random Forest(Best suitable)
#### 4.SVM (Closest border line/ max margin classification)
#### 5.Naive Bayes (learn in each step)

#### Feature Reduction like PCA

Please Visit the Codes for more details.
Thank You.
